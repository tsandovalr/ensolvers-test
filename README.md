## Technologies

### Backend

Nest.JS v8.0.0 -
Node.JS v14.17.6

For testing with postman:
https://ensolvers-back.herokuapp.com/api/tasks

### Frontend

I noticed the similarities between NestJs and Angular, but I did it with React. I enjoyed learning and developing with nest.

Node.JS v14.17.6 -
React v.17.0.2

## Start the app

cd Folder Frontend and then

command: "npm i" to install the node modules and then
"npm start"

The backend is uploaded in heroku so no problem.
